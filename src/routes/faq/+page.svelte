            <span class="font-bold">How should I prepare for my facial?</span><br><br>

            <p class="inline-block">
                Keep your routine simple for the few days before your
                appointment- cleanse, moisturize, and apply sunscreen daily.
                Lay off any active ingredients (this includes AHA's, BHA’s
                retinols, and exfoliants).<br><br>

            <span class="font-bold">If I have allergies, what should I do?</span><br><br>

            <p class="inline-block">
                Please alert your service provider prior to your appointment of
                any allergies you may have, or any skin sensitivities (rosacea,
                eczema, etc.) They will avoid ingredients that may cause an allergic
                reaction. If your allergy is a very common ingredient in the
                skincare line being used, they may not perform the service.
