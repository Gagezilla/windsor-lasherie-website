        <span class="font-medium">How should I prepare for my facial?</span><br><br>

        <p>
            Keep your routine simple for the few days before your
            appointment- cleanse, moisturize, and apply sunscreen daily.
            Lay off any active ingredients (this includes AHA's, BHA’s
            retinols, and exfoliants).<br><br>

        <span class="font-medium">If I have allergies, what should I do?</span><br><br>

        <p>
            Please alert your service provider prior to your appointment of
            any allergies you may have, or any skin sensitivities (rosacea,
            eczema, etc.) They will avoid ingredients that may cause an allergic
            reaction. If your allergy is a very common ingredient in the
            skincare line being used, they may not perform the service.
